echo "These are the steps I will take to contribute to a project"
echo "I will create a directory in my IDE and cd into the directory.
I will clone the project repo into my directory using 'git clone'.
I will then create and switch to a new branch using 'git checkout -b "branchname"'.
I will then make the neccessary changes to the project.
After that I will do git add . to move the project to the staging area.
Then I will commit my changes using 'git commit -m "commit message"'.
Then I will do git push and create an upstream branch in Github.
I will proceed to Github and create a pull request and assign it to the my lead Engineer for review and approval.
After the approval, I will merge into developement branch.
Finally I will delete my upstream branch."
